abstract: "Triple nodal points are degeneracies of energy bands in momentum 
  space at which three Hamiltonian eigenstates coalesce at a single 
  eigenenergy. For spinless particles, the stability of a triple nodal point
  requires two ingredients: rotation symmetry of order three, four or six; 
  combined with mirror or space-time-inversion symmetry. However, despite 
  ample studies of their classification, robust boundary signatures of triple
  nodal points have until now remained elusive. In this work, we first show 
  that pairs of triple nodal points in semimetals and metals can be 
  characterized by Stiefel-Whitney and Euler monopole invariants, of which
  the first one is known to facilitate higher-order topology. Motivated by 
  this observation, we then combine symmetry indicators for corner charges 
  and for the Stiefel-Whitney invariant in two dimensions with the 
  classification of triple nodal points for spinless systems in three 
  dimensions. The result is a complete higher-order bulk-boundary 
  correspondence, where pairs of triple nodal points are characterized by
  fractional jumps of the hinge charge. We present minimal models of the 
  various species of triple nodal points carrying higher-order topology,
  and illustrate the derived correspondence on Sc$_3$AlC which becomes 
  a higher-order triple-point metal in applied strain. The generalization 
  to spinful systems, in particular to the WC-type triple-point 
  material class, is briefly outlined."
