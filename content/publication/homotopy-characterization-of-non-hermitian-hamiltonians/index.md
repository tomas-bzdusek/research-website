abstract: We revisit the problem of classifying topological band structures in
  non-Hermitian systems. Recently, a solution has been proposed, which is based
  on redefining the notion of energy band gap in two different ways, leading to
  the so-called “point-gap” and “line-gap” schemes. However, simple Hamiltonians
  without band degeneracies can be constructed which correspond to neither of
  the two schemes. Here, we resolve this shortcoming of the existing
  classifications by developing the most general topological characterization of
  non-Hermitian bands for systems without a symmetry. Our approach, which is
  based on homotopy theory, makes no particular assumptions on the band gap, and
  predicts significant extensions to the previous classification frameworks. In
  particular, we show that the one-dimensional invariant generalizes from
  $\mathbb{Z}$ winding number to the non-Abelian braid group, and that depending
  on the braid group invariants, the two-dimensional invariants can be cyclic
  groups $\mathbb{Z}_n$ (rather than $\mathbb{Z}$ Chern number). We interpret
  these results in terms of a correspondence with gapless systems, and we
  illustrate them in terms of analogies with other problems in band topology,
  namely, the fragile topological invariants in Hermitian systems and the
  topological defects and textures of nematic liquids.
