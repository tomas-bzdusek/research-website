abstract: The band theory of solids is arguably the most successful theory of
  condensed-matter physics, providing a description of the electronic energy
  levels in various materials. Electronic wavefunctions obtained from the band
  theory enable a topological characterization of metals for which the
  electronic spectrum may host robust, topologically protected, fermionic
  quasiparticles. Many of these quasiparticles are analogues of the elementary
  particles of the Standard Model, but others do not have a counterpart in
  relativistic high-energy theories. A complete list of possible quasiparticles
  in solids is lacking, even in the non-interacting case. Here we describe the
  possible existence of a hitherto unrecognized type of fermionic excitation in
  metals. This excitation forms a nodal chain—a chain of connected loops in
  momentum space—along which conduction and valence bands touch. We prove that
  the nodal chain is topologically distinct from previously reported
  excitations. We discuss the symmetry requirements for the appearance of this
  excitation and predict that it is realized in an existing material, iridium
  tetrafluoride (IrF4), as well as in other compounds of this class of
  materials. Using IrF4 as an example, we provide a discussion of the
  topological surface states associated with the nodal chain. We argue that the
  presence of the nodal-chain fermions will result in anomalous magnetotransport
  properties, distinct from those of materials exhibiting previously known
  excitations.
