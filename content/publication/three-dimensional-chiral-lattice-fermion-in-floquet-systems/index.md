abstract: "We show that the Nielsen-Ninomiya no-go theorem still holds on a
  Floquet lattice: there is an equal number of right-handed and left-handed Weyl
  points in a three-dimensional Floquet lattice. However, in the adiabatic
  limit, where the time evolution of the low-energy subspace is decoupled from
  the high-energy subspace, we show that the bulk dynamics in the low-energy
  subspace can be described by Floquet bands with extra left- or right-handed
  Weyl points, despite the no-go theorem. Assuming adiabatic evolution of two
  bands, we show that the difference of the number of right-handed and
  left-handed Weyl points equals twice the winding number of the adiabatic
  Floquet operator over the Brillouin zone. Based on these findings, we propose
  a realization of purely left- or right-handed Weyl particles on a 3D lattice
  using a Hamiltonian obtained through dimensional reduction of a
  four-dimensional quantum Hall system. We argue that the breakdown of the
  adiabatic approximation on the surface facilitates unusual closed orbits of
  wave packets in an applied magnetic field, which traverse alternatively
  through the low-energy and high-energy sector of the spectrum."
