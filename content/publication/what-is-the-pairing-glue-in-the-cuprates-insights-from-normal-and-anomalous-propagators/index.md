title: What is the pairing glue in the cuprates? Insights from normal and
  anomalous propagators
abstract: Both the pairing and the pair-breaking modes lead to similar kinks of
  the electron dispersion curves in superconductors, and therefore the
  photoemission spectroscopy cannot be straightforwardly applied in search for
  their pairing glue. If the momentum dependence of the normal and anomalous
  self-energy can be neglected, manipulation with the data does allow us to
  extract the gap function  and therefore also the pairing glue. However, in the
  superconducting cuprates, such procedure may not be justified. In this paper,
  we point out that the pairing glue is more directly visible in the spectral
  function of the Nambu–Gor’kov anomalous propagator and we demonstrate that
  this function is in principle experimentally observable.
