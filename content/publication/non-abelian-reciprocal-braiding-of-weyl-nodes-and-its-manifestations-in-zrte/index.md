abstract: Weyl semimetals in three-dimensional crystals provide the paradigm
  example of topologically protected band nodes. It is usually taken for granted
  that a pair of colliding Weyl points annihilate whenever they carry opposite
  chiral charge. In stark contrast, here we report that Weyl points in systems
  that are symmetric under the composition of time reversal with a π rotation
  are characterized by a non-Abelian topological invariant. The topological
  charges of the Weyl points are transformed via braid phase factors, which
  arise upon exchange inside symmetric planes of the reciprocal momentum space.
  We elucidate this process with an elementary two-dimensional tight-binding
  model that is implementable in cold-atom set-ups and in photonic systems. In
  three dimensions, interplay of the non-Abelian topology with point-group
  symmetry is shown to enable topological phase transitions in which pairs of
  Weyl points may scatter or convert into nodal-line rings. By combining our
  theoretical arguments with first-principles calculations, we predict that Weyl
  points occurring near the Fermi level of zirconium telluride carry non-trivial
  values of the non-Abelian charge, and that uniaxial compression strain drives
  a non-trivial conversion of the Weyl points into nodal lines.
