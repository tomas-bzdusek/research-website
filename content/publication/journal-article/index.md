abstract: We present a framework to systematically address topological phases
  when finer partitionings of bands are taken into account, rather than only
  considering the two subspaces spanned by valence and conduction bands.
  Focusing on $C_2\mathcal{T}$--symmetric systems that have gained recent
  attention, for example, in the context of layered van-der-Waals graphene
  heterostructures, we relate these insights to homotopy groups of Grassmannians
  and flag varieties, which in turn correspond to cohomology classes and
  Wilson-flow approaches. We furthermore make use of a geometric construction,
  the so-called Plücker embedding, to induce windings in the band structure
  necessary to facilitate nontrivial topology. Specifically, this directly
  relates to the parametrization of the Grassmannian, which describes
  partitioning of an arbitrary band structure and is embedded in a better
  manageable exterior product space. From a physical perspective, our
  construction encapsulates and elucidates the concepts of fragile topological
  phases beyond symmetry indicators as well as non-Abelian reciprocal braiding
  of band nodes that arises when the multiple gaps are taken into account. The
  adopted geometric viewpoint most importantly culminates in a direct and easily
  implementable method to construct model Hamiltonians to study such phases,
  constituting a versatile theoretical tool.
