abstract: We present a framework to systematically address topological phases
  when finer partitionings of bands are taken into account, rather than only
  considering the two subspaces spanned by valence and conduction bands.
  Focusing on $C_2T$--symmetric systems that have gained recent attention, for
  example, in the context of layered van-der-Waals graphene heterostructures, we
  relate these insights to homotopy groups of Grassmannians and flag varieties,
  which in turn correspond to cohomology classes and Wilson-flow approaches. We
  furthermore make use of a geometric construction, the so-called Plücker
  embedding, to induce windings in the band structure necessary to facilitate
  nontrivial topology. Specifically, this directly relates to the
  parametrization of the Grassmannian, which describes partitioning of an
  arbitrary band structure and is embedded in a better manageable exterior
  product space. From a physical perspective, our construction encapsulates and
  elucidates the concepts of fragile topological phases beyond symmetry
  indicators as well as non-Abelian reciprocal braiding of band nodes that
  arises when the multiple gaps are taken into account. The adopted geometric
  viewpoint most importantly culminates in a direct and easily implementable
  method to construct model Hamiltonians to study such phases, constituting a
  versatile theoretical tool.
