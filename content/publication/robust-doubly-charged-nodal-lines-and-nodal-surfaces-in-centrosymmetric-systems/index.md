abstract: Weyl points in three spatial dimensions are characterized by a
  Z-valued charge—the Chern number—which makes them stable against a wide range
  of perturbations. A set of Weyl points can mutually annihilate only if their
  net charge vanishes, a property we refer to as robustness. While nodal loops
  are usually not robust in this sense, it has recently been shown using
  homotopy arguments that in the centrosymmetric extension of the AI symmetry
  class they nevertheless develop a Z2 charge analogous to the Chern number.
  Nodal loops carrying a nontrivial value of this Z2 charge are robust, i.e.,
  they can be gapped out only by a pairwise annihilation and not on their own.
  As this is an additional charge independent of the Berry π-phase flowing along
  the band degeneracy, such nodal loops are, in fact, doubly charged. In this
  manuscript, we generalize the homotopy discussion to the centrosymmetric
  extensions of all Atland-Zirnbauer classes. We develop a tailored mathematical
  framework dubbed the AZ+$\mathcal{I}$ classification and show that in three
  spatial dimensions such robust and multiply charged nodes appear in four of
  such centrosymmetric extensions, namely, AZ+$\mathcal{I}$ classes CI and AI
  lead to doubly charged nodal lines, while D and BDI support doubly charged
  nodal surfaces. We remark that no further crystalline symmetries apart from
  the spatial inversion are necessary for their stability. We provide a
  description of the corresponding topological charges, and develop simple
  tight-binding models of various semimetallic and superconducting phases that
  exhibit these nodes. We also indicate how the concept of robust and multiply
  charged nodes generalizes to other spatial dimensions.
