abstract: According to a widely held paradigm, a pair of Weyl points with
  opposite chirality mutually annihilate when brought together. In contrast, we
  show that such a process is strictly forbidden for Weyl points related by a
  mirror symmetry, provided that an effective two-band description exists in
  terms of orbitals with opposite mirror eigenvalue. Instead, such a pair of
  Weyl points convert into a nodal loop inside a symmetric plane upon the
  collision. Similar constraints are identified for systems with multiple
  mirrors, facilitating previously unreported nodal-line and nodal-chain
  semimetals that exhibit both Fermi-arc and drumhead surface states. We further
  find that Weyl points in systems symmetric under a π rotation composed with
  time reversal are characterized by an additional integer charge that we call
  helicity. A pair of Weyl points with opposite chirality can annihilate only if
  their helicities also cancel out. We base our predictions on topological
  crystalline invariants derived from relative homotopy theory, and we test our
  predictions on simple tight-binding models. The outlined homotopy description
  can be directly generalized to systems with multiple bands and other choices
  of symmetry.
