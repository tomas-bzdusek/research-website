abstract: We study a class of topological materials which in their
  momentum-space band structure exhibit threefold degeneracies known as triple
  points. Focusing specifically on $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric crystalline solids
  with negligible spin-orbit coupling, we find that such triple points can be
  stabilized by little groups containing a three-, four-, or sixfold rotation
  axis, and we develop a classification of all possible triple points as type A
  vs type B according to the absence vs presence of attached nodal-line arcs.
  Furthermore, by employing the recently discovered non-Abelian band topology,
  we argue that a rotation-symmetry-breaking strain transforms type-A triple
  points into multiband nodal links. Although multiband nodal-line compositions
  were previously theoretically conceived and related to topological monopole
  charges, a practical condensed-matter platform for their manipulation and
  inspection has hitherto been missing. By reviewing the known triple-point
  materials with weak spin-orbit coupling and by performing first-principles
  calculations to predict new ones, we identify suitable candidates for the
  realization of multiband nodal links in applied strain. In particular, we
  report that an ideal compound to study this phenomenon is $\ce{Li2NaN}$, in
  which the conversion of triple points to multiband nodal links facilitates a
  largely tunable density of states and optical conductivity with doping and
  strain, respectively.
