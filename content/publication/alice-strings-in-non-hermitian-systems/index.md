abstract: An Alice string is a topological defect with a very peculiar feature.
  When a defect with a monopole charge encircles an Alice string, the monopole
  charge changes sign. In this paper, we generalize this notion to the momentum
  space of periodic media with loss and gain. In particular, we find that the
  generic band-structure node for a three-dimensional non-Hermitian crystalline
  system acts as an Alice string, which can flip the Chern number charge carried
  by Weyl points and by exceptional-line rings. We discuss signatures of this
  topological structure for a lattice model with one tuning parameter, including
  nontrivial braiding of bulk band nodes, and the spectroscopic features of both
  the bulk and the surface states. We also explore how an Alice string affects
  the validity of the Nielsen-Ninomiya theorem, and present a mathematical
  description of the braiding phenomenon.
