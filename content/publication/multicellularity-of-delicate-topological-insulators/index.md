abstract: Being Wannierizable is not the end of the story for topological insulators. We introduce a family of topological insulators that would be considered trivial in the paradigm set by the tenfold way, topological quantum chemistry, and the method of symmetry-based indicators. Despite having a symmetric, exponentially localized Wannier representation, each Wannier function cannot be completely localized to a single primitive unit cell in the bulk. Such multicellular topology is shown to be neither stable nor fragile, but delicate; i.e., the topology can be nullified by adding trivial bands to either valence or conduction band.
