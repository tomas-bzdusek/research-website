abstract: Being Wannierizable is not the end of the story for topological
  insulators. We introduce a family of topological insulators that would be
  considered trivial in the paradigm set by the tenfold way, topological quantum
  chemistry, and the method of symmetry-based indicators. Despite having a
  symmetric, exponentially-localized Wannier representation, each Wannier
  function cannot be completely localized to a single primitive unit cell in the
  bulk. Such multicellular topology is shown to be neither stable, nor fragile,
  but delicate, i.e., the topology can be nullified by adding trivial bands to
  either valence or conduction band.
