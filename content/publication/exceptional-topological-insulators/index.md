abstract: We introduce the exceptional topological insulator (ETI), a
  non-Hermitian topological state of matter that features exotic non-Hermitian
  surface states which can only exist within the three-dimensional topological
  bulk embedding. We show how this phase can evolve from a Weyl semimetal or
  Hermitian three-dimensional topological insulator close to criticality when
  quasiparticles acquire a finite lifetime. The ETI does not require any
  symmetry to be stabilized. It is characterized by a bulk energy point gap, and
  exhibits robust surface states that cover the bulk gap as a single sheet of
  complex eigenvalues or with a single exceptional point. The ETI can be induced
  universally in gapless solid-state systems, thereby setting a paradigm for
  non-Hermitian topological matter.
