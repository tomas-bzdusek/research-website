abstract: Nodal lines inside the momentum space of three-dimensional crystalline
  solids are topologically stabilized by a pi-flux of Berry phase. Nodal-line
  rings in PT-symmetric systems with negligible spin-orbit coupling (here
  described as “nodal class AI”) can carry an additional “monopole charge,”
  which further enhances their stability. Here, we relate two recent theoretical
  advancements in the study of band topology in nodal class AI. On the one hand,
  cohomology classes of real vector bundles were used to relate the monopole
  charge of nodal-line rings to their linking with nodal lines formed among the
  occupied and among the unoccupied bands. On the other hand, homotopy studies
  revealed that the generalization of the Berry-phase quantization to the case
  of multiple band gaps defines a non-Abelian topological charge, which governs
  the possible deformations of the nodal lines. The present work has three aims.
  First, we present how to efficiently wield the recently discovered non-Abelian
  topological charge. Second, we apply these methods to present an independent
  proof of the relation between the monopole charge and the linking structure,
  including all the fragile-topology exceptions. Finally, we show that the
  monopole charge flips sign when braided along a path with a nontrivial Berry
  phase. This facilitates a new type non-Abelian “braiding” of nodal-line rings
  inside the momentum space, that has not been previously reported. The work
  begins with a brief review of PT-symmetric band topology, and the geometric
  arguments employed in our theoretical analysis are supplemented in the
  appendices with formal mathematical derivations.
