  Deriving Abelian as well as non-Abelian Bloch theorems requires the construction of finite clusters
  of lattice sites and the imposition of periodic boundary conditions (PBC), called PBC clusters.
  However, for hyperbolic lattices the construction of PBC clusters is highly non-trivial and
  requires advanced notions from group theory. Besides one-dimensional irreducible representations
  the elements in the hyperbolic translation groups admit higher-dimensional irreducible representations,
  for which there is no explicit parameterization, making analytical descriptions challenging.
  Previous studies have used Abelian hyperbolic band theory (AHBT) on the primitive cell which do in general not capture the
  thermodynamic limit. Alternatively, they have used brute force exact digitalization, which is
  computationally costly. Therefore, these circumstances motivate the application of approximative
  methods.

  P. M. Lenggenhager et al. have very recently developed a method that
  computationally outperforms the previous approaches. Through the application of the supercell
  method they were able to access non-Abelian Bloch states by considering one-dimensional
  irreducible representations of reduced translation groups. Specifically, they suggested to apply AHBT
  to a appropriately constructed sequence of supercells, assembled as increasingly large aggregates
  of the primitive cells to supercells, and showcased the convergence of this method by selected
  hyperbolic tight-binding models. In conjunction, P. M. Lenggenhager has implemented the supercell
  method within a Mathematica and GAP package.

  As such, the main objective of this thesis is the study of diverse aspects of topology and band
  theory in hyperbolic lattices accessed through the use of the supercell method. We aim to explore
  and broaden some of the recent studies in these systems such as higher-order topological phases,
  anomalous quantum Hall effects, flat bands in realizations of Lieb lattices, and
  non-Hermiticity driven topological phenomena.
