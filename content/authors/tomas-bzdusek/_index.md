I am a professor at the [Physics Institute](https://www.physik.uzh.ch/en.html) of the University of Zürich, where I lead the research group Topological Matter and Matematerials. We are theoretical consensed matter physicist, and the team investigates diverse aspects of topological phases of matter. Much of my recent work applies the ideas of homotopy theory to classify topology of single-particle Hamiltonians, with applications to topological insulators, semimetals and insulators, as well as to dissipative (non-Hermitian) and periodically driven (Floquet) systems. More lately, we have also ventured into the investigation of physics in hyperbolic lattices.

I obtained my undegraduate degrees at [Comenius University](https://fmph.uniba.sk/en/) in Bratislava under the supervision of Richard Hlubina, and I did my doctoral studies at the Department of Physics of [ETH Zürich](https://www.phys.ethz.ch/) in the group of Manfred Sigrist. Afterwards, I spend two years as the Gordon and Betty Moore Fellow at the Geballe Laboratory for Advanced Materials at [Stanford University](https://glam.stanford.edu/), and four years as an Ambizione Scientist in the [CMT group](https://www.psi.ch/en/lsm/cmt-group) at the [Paul Scherrer Institute](https://www.psi.ch/en) in Villigen, Switzerland. During the latter, I have also been associated as a Senior Scientist with the [group](https://www.physik.uzh.ch/en/groups/neupert/team.html) of Prof. Titus Neupert at the [University of Zürich](https://www.uzh.ch/cmsssl/en.html), Switzerland.
