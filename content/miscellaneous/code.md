    <h2>Second Chern number</h2>
    <p>Mathematica code to compute the second Chern number of a four-dimensional (topological) band insulator, downloadable from <a   href="http://dx.doi.org/10.13140/RG.2.2.35088.12801">ResearchGate</a>. It is an implementation of the algorithm that is discussed (and its convergence is investigated) in M. Mochol-Grzelak, A. Dauphin, A. Celi, and M. Lewenstein, Quantum Sci. Technol. 4 014009 (2019) DOI:<a href="https://doi.org/10.1088/2058-9565/aae93b">10.1088/2058-9565/aae93b</a>.     </p>

    <h2>Patch Euler class </h2>
<p>Mathematica code that computes the <i>patch Euler class</i> of a pair of bands on a region (the patch) with a boundary. The patch Euler class is an invariant for systems with $C_2\mathcal{T}$-symmetry (and for spinless systems with $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry), which determines whether a pair of Dirac points are able to annihilate along a prescribed trajectory. The algorithm, as described in the supplementary material to  , corresponds to a computationally efficient way to extract the most relevant bit of information of the non-Abelian topological invariant discussed in
