<p>Mathematica code to compute the second Chern number of a four-dimensional (topological) band insulator, downloadable from <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.13140/RG.2.2.35088.12801">ResearchGate</a>. It is an implementation of the algorithm that is discussed (and its convergence is investigated) in M. Mochol-Grzelak, A. Dauphin, A. Celi, and M. Lewenstein, Quantum Sci. Technol. 4 014009 (2019) DOI: https://doi.org/10.1088/2058-9565/aae93b.</p>

<p>Mathematica code that computes the <i>patch Euler class</i> of a pair of bands on a region (the patch) with a boundary.</p>
