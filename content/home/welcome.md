Hi there! I am a Professor leading the group [Theory of Topological Matter](https://www.physik.uzh.ch/en/groups/bzdusek.html) at the [University of ZÃ¼rich](https://www.physik.uzh.ch/en.html), Switzerland. You can read more about my research in my [profile](https://www.tomasbzdusek.com/author/tomas-bzdusek/). On these pages, which have until recently served as my personal website, I have collected the research work of myself and of my students. In the "miscellaneous" tab I have collected various further documents, including recorded talks, slides, and code. Note that this page is currently in reconstruction.

<b>News!</b> Following my successful application for a Starting Grant by [SNSF](https://data.snf.ch/grants/grant/211310), we are seeking one more PhD student</b>, envisioned to start between October 2023 and April 2024. The hiring announcement can be found [here](https://www.physik.uzh.ch/en/department/jobs.html). Follow our updates on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/UZH_TopoMat) and [Mastodon]("https://mastodon.social/@tomas_bzdusek").
