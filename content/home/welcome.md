My name is Tomáš Bzdušek and I am a postdoctoral fellow in the [CMT group](https://www.psi.ch/en/lsm/cmt-group) at the [Paul Scherrer Institute](https://www.psi.ch/en) in Villigen, Switzerland. I am also associated with the [group](https://www.physik.uzh.ch/en/groups/neupert/team.html) of Prof. Titus Neupert at the [University of Zürich](https://www.uzh.ch/cmsssl/en.html), Switzerland. You can read more about my research in my [profile](https://www.tomasbzdusek.com/author/tomas-bzdusek/).

On this website I have collected the research work of myself and of my students. <!--- You can follow our updates on Twitter. --> In the "miscellaneous" tab I have collected various further documents, including recorded talks, slides, and code. 

The website is currently in construction, and is expected to be complete by April 2021.
