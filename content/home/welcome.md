Hi there! I am a postdoctoral fellow in the [CMT group](https://www.psi.ch/en/lsm/cmt-group) at the [Paul Scherrer Institute](https://www.psi.ch/en) in Villigen, Switzerland. I am also associated with the [group](https://www.physik.uzh.ch/en/groups/neupert/team.html) of Prof. Titus Neupert at the [University of Zürich](https://www.uzh.ch/cmsssl/en.html), Switzerland. You can read more about my research in my [profile](https://www.tomasbzdusek.com/author/tomas-bzdusek/).

On this website I have collected the research work of myself and of my students. In the "miscellaneous" tab I have collected various further documents, including recorded talks, slides, and code. 

<b>News!</b> Following my successful application for a Starting Grant by [SNSF](https://data.snf.ch/grants/grant/211310), I am launching a new research group at the University of Zürich in September 2023. <b>We are currently looking for one more PhD student</b>, envisioned to start between October 2023 and April 2024. The hiring announcement can be found [here](https://www.physik.uzh.ch/en/department/jobs.html). Follow our updates on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/UZH_TopoMat) and [Mastodon]("https://mastodon.social/@tomas_bzdusek").
