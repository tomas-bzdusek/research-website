Hi there! I am a postdoctoral fellow in the [CMT group](https://www.psi.ch/en/lsm/cmt-group) at the [Paul Scherrer Institute](https://www.psi.ch/en) in Villigen, Switzerland. I am also associated with the [group](https://www.physik.uzh.ch/en/groups/neupert/team.html) of Prof. Titus Neupert at the [University of Zürich](https://www.uzh.ch/cmsssl/en.html), Switzerland. You can read more about my research in my [profile](https://www.tomasbzdusek.com/author/tomas-bzdusek/).

On this website I have collected the research work of myself and of my students. In the "miscellaneous" tab I have collected various further documents, including recorded talks, slides, and code. 

<b>News!</b> Following my successful application for a Starting Grant by SNSF, I will be launching a research group at the University of Zürich in October 2023. For that occassion <b>I will be hiring two doctoral students and one postdoc</b>. More information will be communicated here, as well as on the [University website](https://www.physik.uzh.ch/en/department/jobs.html) and on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/tomasbzdusek), by January 2023. Interested <b>applicants for a bachelor or a master thesis project </b> at the University of Zurich are welcome to ask me about possible projects at any time, as we could start working on these immediately.
