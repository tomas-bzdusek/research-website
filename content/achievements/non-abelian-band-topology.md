  <h2>Non-Abelian band topology</h2>
  <p>Band structures of non-interacting particles can be characterized by topological numbers; 
    famous examples being the $\mathbb{Z}$-valued Chern number of Weyl points, and the $\mathbb{Z}_2$-valued Kane-Mele invariant 
    of topological insulators. The groups capturing the topological invariant of single-particle energy bands were essentially 
    always assumed to be Abelian – until we discovered a counterexample [1]. Led by intuition from the physics of
    biaxial nematic and cholesteric liquids, we showed that band nodes of certain $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric and $C_2\mathcal{T}$-symmetric 
    systems are characterized by a previously overlooked non-commutative quaternion charges. </p>
  <p>The non-Abelian topological invariant implies, among other things, that certain species of nodal 
    lines cannot be moved across one another by tuning the Hamiltonian parameters [1]. Remarkably, it also 
    enables a “reciprocal braiding” effect, meaning that the capability of band nodes to pairwise annihilate
    depends on the trajectory used to bring them together in $\boldsymbol{k}$-space [2]. The non-Abelian band topology 
    brings under one umbrella several notions of topological band theory, including monopole charges, linking 
    structures, fragile topology, and characteristic classes [2—5]. It predicts a non-Abelian generalization of
    topological insulators in 1D, and it persists in the stable limit of many bands. This discovery leads to a 
    plethora of open questions, including the search for clear experimental observables, which would be of major 
    importance in near future.</p>
  <p>The recipe to obtain such more general topological structures is remarkably simply: consider a partitioning 
    of bands which differs from the most typical twofold separation into the “occupied” vs. the “unoccupied” ones.
    Mathematically, this corresponds to describing the band structure by flag bundles rather than by vector bundles [6]. 
    This generalization might thus also be stimulating for research in mathematical physics. The generalized partitioning 
    of bands is physically well motivated when describing band degeneracies, but it also arises very naturally in 
    non-Hermitian setting [7], where the non-Abelian phenomenon results in a non-trivial interplay of invariants 
    defined on manifolds of different dimensions.</p>
