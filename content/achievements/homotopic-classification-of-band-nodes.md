  <h2>Homotopic classification of band nodes</h2>
  <p>A few years back, the broad community studying topological band theory started reporting a plethora of stable band degeneracies, so-called “nodes”. Dirac points were followed by Weyl points, ushering a way towards composite fermions, nodal lines, nodal chains, and even nodal surfaces. The range of systems that can exhibit these features is also very wide, extending to superconductors, phonons, and artificially designed photonic and cold-atoms systems. The motivation to investigate these band degeneracies has been the hope that their occurrence would facilitate unusual transport phenomena or surface signatures.</p>
  <p>I attempted to bring some order into this zoo of possibilities. By treating band nodes as singularities for spectral flattening of the Bloch Hamiltonian, I applied homotopy theory to systematically classify a wide range of band nodes and of their topological charges [1]. The strategy is, in spirit, analogous to the description of topological defects in ordered media as famously reviewed by Mermin [2]. My analysis led to the prediction of nodal surfaces in centrosymmetric time-reversal breaking superconductors such as SrAsPt (independently predicted for URu2Si2 [3]) and to the characterization of nodal rings with a monopole charge (found e.g. in certain antiferromagnets [4]). In the latter case, I implicitly stumbled upon the fragile topology, which has recently been implicated to play a role in twisted bilayer graphene near the “magic angle” [5].</p>
  <p>The homotopic perspective on topological band theory is a gift that keeps on giving, and it allowed us to predict several phenomena which were entirely overlooked by previous studies. On one hand, in analogy with the description of surface defects (so-called “boojums”) in ordered media, we used relative homotopy to predict conversions of Weyl nodes to nodal rings [6], which we recently reported to occur at the Fermi level of $\textrm{ZrTe}$ under strain. On the other hand, by considering the action of the fundamental group on higher homotopy groups (which prominently arises in nematic liquids), we predicted an intrinsic reduction of the $K$-theoretic classification of energy bands in various systems, including dissipative photonics [7].</p>
